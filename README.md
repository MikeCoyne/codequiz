 This is the CODE QUIZ. It is a code-related terminology quiz which is at most thirty seconds in duration. For every incorrect answer input from the user, two seconds are deducted from the remaining time. Time left when all quesitons have been answered is the player's score. Players are intended to have a means to save their score on an attached page, however this is not fully functioning yet.
